/**
 * Program should follow some simple rules:
 * 1. It is a base independent unit which can contain subprograms or do something by itself.
 *    (NOT BOTH)
 * 2. Required 'apply' method serves for: ```
 * - initial data binding
 * - subprograms initialisation
 * - hooks subscription
 * - error handling
 * ```
 *    In most cases hook **execution** here will be archtecture mistake.
 *
 * 3. Program can be subprogram. This can be detected by non empty param passed to `apply` method.
 *    But anyway program should be independent unit.
 * 4. Optional 'action' method - is a main place for hooks call.
 *    For compatibility with Commander.Command->action methos result shoul be void.
 * 5. Complex hook calls should be designed as external private methods named as 'hookMethodName'
 *    (example: hookConfig)
